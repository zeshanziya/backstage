        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: We've set up the new <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community plugins repository</a>, and have migrated most of the packages in the <code>plugins</code> directory of the main Backstage repository to their new home!</p>
<p>For those who depended on these plugins, migrating is as simple as <code>yarn backstage-cli versions:bump</code> then <code>yarn backstage-cli versions:migrate</code>. If you're already on <code>1.26.1</code>, then be sure to run <code>yarn backstage-cli versions:bump --skip-migrate</code> then <code>yarn backstage-cli versions:migrate</code> to take advantage of the code reference replacement helpers.</p>

<p>Some of you who have been around a while, or have seen our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONMBYnhxnNU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maintainer Track talks</a> at KubeCon, might have seen <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/20266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this RFC</a> which outlines some issues with the scale of the <code>backstage/backstage</code> monorepo, and us as maintainers being the de facto owners of all plugins without a <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#project-area" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project area</a> or <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#project-area-maintainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plugin maintainer</a>.</p>
<p>There was some great discussion in this issue, and some great ideas. One of the ideas was to create a dedicated home for community plugins, with all the burden of release tooling and workspace tooling already set up, which is a pretty big barrier for people wanting to create plugins for Backstage in their own organization or personal account. These plugins would then have the ability to release independently of the main monorepo, and have their own release cadence, which is something that we've been looking at exploring for a while.</p>
<p>With Red Hat wanting to join forces and help get this set up, this is the path that we picked, and the last few months have been a lot of hard work from both sides getting this repository in shape and coming up with a deprecation plan for these plugins in the main repository.</p>
<p>Would also like to give a shoutout to all the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/OWNERS.md#community-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Plugins project area</a> maintainers, who have been helping get us to this state! <a href="https://github.com/vinzscam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@vinzscam</a> <a href="https://github.com/tudi2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@tudi2d</a> <a href="https://github.com/BethGriggs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@bethgriggs</a> <a href="https://github.com/kadel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@kadel</a> <a href="https://github.com/awanlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@awanlin</a> üëè</p>
<p>And now with the release of <code>1.26.3</code> there's a large amount of plugins from the main monorepo that have been migrated over to the new <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community plugins repository</a>. <!-- -->üéâ</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-migration">The migration<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2024/04/19/community-plugins#the-migration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The migration" title="Direct link to The migration">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>With the moving of these plugins, we thought it would also be a good time to move the <code>npm</code> scope, so that end users can differentiate between Backstage packages, and community-maintained packages. So the <code>@backstage-community</code> namespace was born!</p>
<p>This makes migration a little tricky for end users, as there's going to be code references and <code>package.json</code> dependencies pointing to the older packages which are no longer going to be published.</p>
<p>We've added some tooling into the <code>@backstage/cli</code> which is going to smooth the transition here. The last versions which are published under the <code>@backstage/</code> scope from the monorepo, will have a special field in the <code>package.json</code> with a hint to the CLI as to what this package is now called.</p>
<p>The CLI will then be able to replace these references inside the <code>./src</code> folder of your codebase, and update your <code>package.json</code> dependencies to the new <code>@backstage-community</code> scope.</p>
<p>You can migrate today by running the following:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#9CDCFE;--prism-background-color:#232323"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#232323"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(106, 153, 85)"># &lt; 1.26.1</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(220, 220, 170)">yarn</span><span class="token plain"> backstage-cli versions:bump</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(220, 220, 170)">yarn</span><span class="token plain"> backstage-cli versions:migrate</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(106, 153, 85)"># 1.26.1</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(220, 220, 170)">yarn</span><span class="token plain"> backstage-cli versions:bump --skip-migrate</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(220, 220, 170)">yarn</span><span class="token plain"> backstage-cli versions:migrate</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>From this latest <code>1.26.3</code> release and onwards, the <code>backstage-cli versions:bump</code> command will automatically check for moved packages, so you shouldn't have to worry about running this every time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="help-my-plugin-has-been-moved">Help! My plugin has been moved!<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2024/04/19/community-plugins#help-my-plugin-has-been-moved" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Help!

<p>No stress! If you were a <code>CODEOWNER</code> of the code in the monorepo, these permissions will be migrated over to the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community plugins repository</a> so you should still have access to the code. And now you're in charge of releasing your own plugin! üöÄ You can do that by following the same flow from the monorepo, with changesets and merging the <code>Version Packages (My Plugin)</code> PR.</p>

<p>We've taken a pretty big chunk of the plugins from the main monorepo and moved them over to the new repository. There could be more plugins over time that are moved, or even ones that we promote back to the main monorepo.</p>

<p>There's going to be a little bit of time now in this migration period where there's going to be issues and pull requests not in the right place, and we're going to do our best to transfer issues to the community plugins repository instead. We will shortly be removing the code for these plugins from the main monorepo as it now has a new home in the community plugins repository.</p>
<p>We're also going to be looking at bringing in some more of the great tooling from the <code>backstage/backstage</code> monorepo into the community plugins repository to help out with more automation for dependency bumps, etc.</p>

<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> Next door at Platform Engineering Day, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/samanthacoffman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samantha Coffman</a> (Senior Product Manager, Spotify) was representing Backstage in her talk "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_KCOcoliLI&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2Me-TpMQFvCphDu_xm71ed_&amp;index=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boosting Developer Platform Teams with Product Thinking</a>".</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the talks, it was great to meet so many different members of the community, both those who've been using Backstage since the beginning as well as people who are just learning about internal developer portals and the open source platform. I had so many great conversations, I started to lose my voice ‚Äî and it was only the first day.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: For the Backstage maintainers, ensuring that the project is secure for every adopter and end user is one of our top priorities.
With the recent discovery of <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-26150</a>, we've shipped fixes for versions &gt; v1.15.0.
Please update your Backstage instance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Security Audit &amp;amp; Updates" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/backstage-security-audit-d0283e8fb2fc980642fd9b4be7057cf5.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<!-- -->
<p>Last week we were notified by <a href="https://roadie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roadie</a> of a potential security vulnerability in the scaffolder that they had discovered during a third-party security audit.
Roadie are running their scaffolder tasks in an isolated, ephemeral container to mitigate these kinds of issues, but as good citizens of the Backstage community, they alerted the Backstage maintainer team to make sure a fix was applied to the upstream project.
Upon further investigation, it turned out that this was a more widespread issue with the <code>resolveSafeChildPath</code> utility from the <code>@backstage/backend-common</code> package, which is used to prevent path traversal exploits.
This issue has now been fixed, and also backported to cover releases up to almost a year old.</p>
<p>Please make sure that you have updated your Backstage instance to the latest v.1.23.2, or that you are using <code>@backstage/backend-common</code> <code>v0.21.1</code>, <code>v0.19.10</code>, or <code>v0.20.2</code>.
If you are building backend plugins for Backstage and do any local file operations, make sure you use the <code>resolveSafeChildPath</code> utility, as this check is quite tricky to implement correctly üòä</p>
<p>Thanks to Roadie and the team for reporting this issue, and making the Backstage community safe!</p>

<p>tl;dr BackstageCon North America is officially in the books! We had a blast in Chicago talking about Backstage non-stop throughout the week at both BackstageCon and KubeCon. If you weren't able to join us, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BackstageCon talks are available</a> for replay on the CNCF YouTube channel.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Obviously we're biased, but Backstage was definitely one of the big topics at <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America</a> this year. Recently, the CNCF announced that Backstage was the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/10/27/october-2023-where-we-are-with-velocity-of-cncf-lf-and-top-30-open-source-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third fastest-growing project</a> of the year (up from the fifth last year). And you could confirm it with your own eyes during BackstageCon and KubeCon: hundreds of people flocked through the event, talks, and the project booth sharing their enthusiasm and asking more questions about the project.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backstagecon-a-growing-community">BackstageCon: A growing community&nbsp;<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/11/15/backstagecon-kubecon-23#backstagecon-a-growing-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BackstageCon: A growing community&nbsp;" title="Direct link to BackstageCon: A growing community&nbsp;">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>With a whopping peak attendance of 400+ people, the crowd nearly doubled from last year,<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2023/11/14/backstage-project-takes-center-stage-at-kubecon-north-america-2023/?sh=1972303a6539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> taking the center stage of the conference</a>, as reported by Forbes. For some, BackstageCon was their first entry point into the community, but the event also boasted lots of&nbsp; familiar faces, mostly from some of the most mature adopters such as Dynatrace, Lunar, and US Bank. We also got to hear from new voices in the community like Comcast and Grafana Labs.</p>
<p>We hear a lot of great questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do I make more developers use my developer portal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will generative AI take my Backstage instance to the next level?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's all the fuss around the upcoming Declarative Integration in Backstage?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The community got together to discuss these and more questions with exciting talks and debates. The talks were all recorded and are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up on YouTube</a>, so make sure to check them out.</p>
<p><strong>Driving Backstage adoption</strong></p>
<p>Growing adoption was top of mind during BackstageCon. David Tuite, CEO of Roadie, shared the lessons learned from interviewing 20 adopters, which revealed that the Scaffolder was a prime place to get started when adopting Backstage, as it lets stakeholders get an easily measurable ROI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Panel of Backstage adopters" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/10-panel-f55c9936ee6e6d1d976be82574658f0e.jpg" width="1999" height="1500" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Helen Greul, Head of Engineering for Backstage at Spotify, hosted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iti5glzYOG8&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&amp;index=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a panel discussion</a> with four adopters that are using Backstage at scale: Twilio, Lunar Bank, US Bank, and Expedia. The crucial role of Backstage in fostering inner sourcing and simplifying new hires onboarding were a few of the subjects covered in the panel.</p>
<p>How adopters are using Backstage was also a highlight of the day. B3, Brazil's Stock Exchange, shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyWCKIVYO7g&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&amp;index=14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how they're building their developer portal</a>. And from Grafana Labs, we heard how they're using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-JUWob69Hw&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&amp;index=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage along Crossplane to drive GitOps</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What's next with Backstage?</strong></p>
<p>The discussion on how Backstage is evolving was featured in a few talks, through live demos that ‚Äî remarkably ‚Äî did not go wrong even once! Ben (<a href="https://github.com/benjdlambert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benjdlambert</a>) and Patrik (<a href="https://github.com/Rugvip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rugvip</a>), core maintainers, presented an introduction to the plans around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hVMNMXXN44&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&amp;index=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Declarative Integration</a>, which will allow people to install plugins without dealing with TypeScript or React. On the other hand, Djamaile and Mitch, from Spotify, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUdaO9NKXJY&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&amp;index=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced the upcoming Quickstart</a>, a tool from Spotify in private-beta that will allow anyone to get started with Backstage through a GUI in a few steps.</p>
<p><strong>A thriving community</strong></p>
<p>People gathered outside the conference room where BackstageCon was happening to catch up with each other and learn from the event sponsors. It was great to connect with everyone and talk about how everyone is using Backstage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="KubeCon Attendees" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/20-booth-b2a4d9d8d1f03a675222faa335f443d4.jpg" width="1999" height="1500" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>The interest from the cloud-native community in Backstage did not waver this year. Instead, the Backstage booth in the KubeCon Project Pavillion saw a nonstop flux of visitors asking more about the project. There were three talks featuring Backstage during KubeCon.</p>
<p><strong>Backstage talks during KubeCon NA '23</strong></p>
<p>The first talk touching on Backstage of the schedule was Tim Hansen's (<a href="https://github.com/timbonicus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timbonicus</a>) "Everything Is Code: Embracing GitOps at Spotify," who achieved rockstar status thanks to his phenomenal insights. The queue to ask questions after the talk's questions was surreal!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="KubeCon Attendees" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/40-tim-talk-ba14abf3c76daf3c15ae23361eb2e6e9.jpg" width="1999" height="1500" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Backstage maintainers Ben and Patrik addressed a full-room during their talk ‚ÄúSimplifying Backstage - Breaking the Code Barrier‚Äù in which they explained Declarative Integration, how it works and the expected migration path. Declarative Integration will enable adopters to install the plugins they use‚Äîand even customize them‚Äîwithout dealing with TypeScript or React.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="KubeCon Attendees" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/50-patrik-ben-full-16bb2a4ab471ae541d6f3891da9bef94.jpg" width="1999" height="1500" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>And to close the event, Ritesh Patel, Nirmata and David Murphy, Upbound, introduced the BACK Stack, which stands for Backstage, Argo, Crossplane, and Kyverno. These four tools make up a powerful combo that can enable self-service workflows secure and scalable. After a great demo, the speakers presented a reference architecture that can help guide an approach to using Backstage to build your platform.</p>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR <a href="https://www.chicagotrading.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Trading Company</a> (CTC) adopted Backstage ten months ago to help reduce onboarding frictions with their new cloud-based DevOps Kubernetes platform. Through templatization and open feedback loops, the team has conservatively saved 18 months of developer time to date with Backstage. We spoke with CTC DevOps engineer <a href="https://github.com/scott-kausler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Kausler</a> who shared the details of their onboarding journey, lessons learned, and insights for other Backstage adopters.</em></strong></p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="templates-or-the-cluster-didnt-happen">Templates or the cluster didn't happen<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/09/29/chicago-traiding-company-adopter-spotlight#templates-or-the-cluster-didnt-happen" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Templates or the cluster didn't happen" title="Direct link to Templates or the cluster didn't happen">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>While mid-activation on a new cloud-based DevOps Kubernetes platform, Scott's team received early feedback that it was difficult to onboard teams onto this platform due to the breadth of requirements and new tools developers needed ‚Äî from dependency management tools (such as Gradle, Conan, and Conda) to Docker/Kubernetes, Helm/FluxCD, and Vault. Not only were CTC developers required to learn new systems to build, package, and deploy their apps, in several cases even the code needed to be changed. There were also significant modifications required to existing tools such as Jenkins.</p>
<p>Scott's team quickly recognized that this friction could lead to lower adoption and longer onboarding times to the new platform. So he started investigating solutions that would allow him to templatize these new services and create turnkey onboarding with less reference knowledge required.</p>
<p>After exploring several service routes from managed to in-house/owned, CTC opted to use Backstage ‚Äî already in POC for use of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Catalog</a> ‚Äî due to the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Templates</a> plugin form-based input, UI/json-schema-form abilities, and its extensibility. Scott's team felt Backstage provided the most sustainable solution for growth amongst the multiple developer portal and templation options vetted and would help bridge the gap between UI-driven deployment and GitOps.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="early-wins-on-documentation-and-onboarding">Early wins on documentation and onboarding<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/09/29/chicago-traiding-company-adopter-spotlight#early-wins-on-documentation-and-onboarding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Early wins on documentation and onboarding" title="Direct link to Early wins on documentation and onboarding">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The CTC DevOps team created a small special interest group to champion the developer portal build and quickly delved into the big issues impacting their developer experience. From there, the team began creating tasks and templates within Backstage.</p>
<p>To start, Scott worked with end-user teams outside DevOps early in the process of documenting migration to the new DevOps Kubernetes platform services. When Scott wrote the onboarding documentation, he made it a point to pair with a developer on another team that would be using it. This approach provided him with a quality sounding board, great instantaneous feedback, and a sort of "beta developer" to test V1 documentation clarity., A few weeks later, another colleague on the same end-user team followed the documentation and she didn't reach out to Scott at all.</p>
<p>After this early win, the team was ready for broad distribution. Partnering with the senior leadership team, Scott's team began onboarding teams to the new DevOps Kubernetes platform using the templates his team created in Backstage. At CTC, their Backstage instance is set up to automatically scan for deployments in Kubernetes; so if you're in Kubernetes, you're onboarded to Backstage.</p>
<p>"Backstage made onboarding [to the new DevOps platform] not scary,"" Scott said. "Because now ‚Äî all of a sudden ‚Äî you have this recipe for how to do it, you don't have to jump through these hoops, the templates are there and ready for you. You choose what you want based on these templates we have available, and you're off and running on your own.""</p>
<p>Scott's team monitored progress against their onboarding goals partially by how often the DevOps team was getting pinged for support and found that it has made support smoother. They can easily refer people to templates and repo standards instead of making them create something ad hoc.</p>
<p>"It's really been cool seeing how that progressed. I even have a few teams that didn't talk to DevOps at all. They used a [template] and they have a service ready. We were actually pretty excited about that, because that means now we have a scalable tool able to onboard others onto our platform."" said Scott.</p>
<p>Another exciting win for CTC was template additions generated outside the initial toolkit, which has eased the burden substantially for the DevOps team. They were able to create new templates to deploy against best practices such as a template for creating a brand-new Terraform module and Git repo or ‚Äî Scott's favorite ‚Äî ‚Äã‚Äãa template that creates a Java repository along with Jenkins jobs for CI and the Flux CD config for deployment.</p>
<p>"The template builds and auto-deploys a Docker image, so if you make a change to your mainline branch, then it will automatically build a new Docker image and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster."" Scott said. "So within basically 10 minutes of you filling out a form, you actually have something deployed out to a Kubernetes cluster.""</p>
<p>This process eased flows for both end-user devs and DevOps teams overall.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="measuring-backstage-impact-at-ctc">Measuring Backstage impact at CTC<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/09/29/chicago-traiding-company-adopter-spotlight#measuring-backstage-impact-at-ctc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Measuring Backstage impact at CTC" title="Direct link to Measuring Backstage impact at CTC">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>To calculate the impact of Backstage, Scott began with reviewing template types and assigning a weighted value to each based upon their perceived workload.</p>
<p>At CTC, some templates create a repo, some templates create a repo with some code, some templates even go as far as creating a repo with code and all the prerequisites to deploy to Flux and Jenkins jobs. To be conservative, the highest weight Scott assigned to a template would be saving three days of developer time. Even with that conservative estimate, the figure came out to be a savings of 18 months in developer effort since Backstage was deployed ten months ago.</p>
<p>For CTC, the journey with Backstage has just begun. They're now looking to drive more Catalog adoption and determine what custom plugins they need to build to better support their workflows.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-partnership-and-good-docs">The power of partnership (and good docs!)<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/09/29/chicago-traiding-company-adopter-spotlight#the-power-of-partnership-and-good-docs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The power of partnership (and good docs!)" title="Direct link to The power of partnership (and good docs!)">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>When asked about advice he has for other Backstage adopters, Scott talked about the DevOps team's comms strategy and ensuring end-user developers had pathways to provide feedback. In addition to the focus on templates for the new services, having both a dedicated Slack channel and open-door communication with the DevOps team helped reduce onboarding friction to the DevOps Kubernetes platform.</p>
<p>Outside of that, he believes the approach to documentation is paramount. "Write your documentation from the perspective of, 'Hey, you have this task assigned to you to write a template, here are the exact steps you have to follow.'"" Scott said. "Think of it as a recipe. Removing your familiarity bias will help make this tool more useful for less familiar teams.""</p>
<p>Finally, don't be afraid to step outside the core use cases when it comes to the Backstage framework and finding solutions to meet your needs.</p>
<p>"Backstage gives you a lot of really easy to use features right out of the box. And one of the great things about open source is you can look at the code and see exactly what the behavior is and work within that behavior. But we've also developed our own processes for custom tasks because ‚Äî at the end of the day ‚Äî our platform has some very custom aspects to it."" Scott said.</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: In this post, Expedia Group provides a follow-up to their initial Q4 2021 <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-proof-of-value-at-expedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on how they measure Backstage proof of value</a>.
We're grateful to the Expedia Group team for sharing their processes, revised proof of value metrics, and adaptations to their approach over time in hopes of providing a successful framework for the rest of the Backstage community.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://expediagroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expedia Group's</a> mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere.
This vision is made possible through Expedia Group's massive platform, which connects 168 million loyalty members, 50 thousand B2B partners, 3 million properties and 500 airlines, car rentals and cruise lines across the globe. In short, the scale of our platform is enormous, which means that we need to scale our engineering capabilities as well so we can continue to provide seamless experiences to our travelers and partners.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>In August 2020, we adopted Backstage to enhance our foundational platform capabilities and reduce developer friction in the process. Its framework proved scalable for us and as EG's platform evolved, so did our application of Backstage. Since our <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-proof-of-value-at-expedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial share about our Backstage deployment</a>, we've continued to follow our process of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncing Expedia Group's internal Developer Journey phases by key DevOps processes and Software Delivery Life Cycle (SDLC) milestones (POC, Alpha, Beta, etc).</li>
<li>Identifying Developer Jobs to be Done (JTBD) by our Internal Developer Journey phases</li>
<li>Aligning developer JTBD's to proof of value (PoV) metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the diagram below, you can see how we distilled these processes into Backstage PoV metrics.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="backstage pov metrics" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/table-29c0da3fec72d6a9999069155af7280d.png" width="1294" height="565" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>To ground ourselves in the evolving developer and Backstage landscape at Expedia Group, we constantly ask ourselves, "How can we continue to show the value of Backstage to our customers and the Developer Community?" To fully answer this question, we adapted our initial proof of value metrics to reinforce our alignment to the current landscape of the Expedia Group developer journey.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expedia-group-proof-of-value-metrics-20">Expedia Group proof of value metrics 2.0<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/08/17/expedia-proof-of-value-metrics-2#expedia-group-proof-of-value-metrics-20" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expedia Group proof of value metrics 2.0" title="Direct link to Expedia Group proof of value metrics 2.0">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>We are excited to share our PoV metrics because it affirms our investment in Backstage for Expedia Group's Backstage users and provides a compelling metrics-based answer on why more organizations should consider adopting it.</p>
<p>As our Backstage application matured, we updated our PoV metrics and aligned our 2023 roadmap to reflect these changes. Below, we highlight key wins from 2022 and outline our long-term vision for each metric.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="backstage header" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/header-96abda0eb0018d6cef5a8c9244ae57af.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>At <a href="https://frontside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontside</a>, our goal is to help cloud-native teams create cohesive development experiences. We've been at the Backstage party since the beginning helping companies adopt and extend Backstage to fit the needs of their unique ecosystems.</p>
<p>Through our experience, we've uncovered five common traits of organizations that have improved developer experience through successful Backstage implementation and adoption. In this blog, we'll dive into these traits with some thoughts on how you can follow their blueprint.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-they-take-a-product-centric-approach"><strong>1) They take a product-centric approach</strong><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/28/frontside-adopter-post#1-they-take-a-product-centric-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1-they-take-a-product-centric-approach" title="Direct link to 1-they-take-a-product-centric-approach">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The biggest factor for successful adopters of Backstage is their approach. There is a high correlation of success within organizations that approach building a developer portal like they're building a product. Some organizations will jump straight into solutioning instead of taking their time to identify what the problems are, how they affect users, and how those issues can be addressed.</p>
<p>The team building out Backstage should assess or work from existing insights on the core challenges that developers are facing in their organization ‚Äî both qualitative and quantitative data counts here ‚Äî and connect those issues to a product roadmap with initial use cases and adoption milestones marked. By doing their research in advance, successful orgs have a clear vision of what they want to accomplish with their Backstage instance. They know exactly what goals need to be met and have pressure-tested potential issues and barriers.</p>
<p>If you've already started your Backstage adoption journey but haven't mapped a Product Requirements Document (or PRD), don't panic! There is always time to do the foundational knowledge-building necessary to deploy something successful.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-they-tie-backstage-to-a-larger-platform-journey"><strong>2) They tie Backstage to a larger platform journey</strong><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/28/frontside-adopter-post#2-they-tie-backstage-to-a-larger-platform-journey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2-they-tie-backstage-to-a-larger-platform-journey" title="Direct link to 2-they-tie-backstage-to-a-larger-platform-journey">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Platform engineering has emerged in response to the growing complexity of cloud-native software architecture. Backstage has a huge role to play in implementing a platform strategy but its part of a larger story. Having buy-in from both higher ups and the teams tasked with platform goals is an essential step in successful Backstage adoption. Without the support at the top, it can be difficult to implement platforming as a priority within your organization.</p>
<p>And by "the top", we don't necessarily mean your CTO needs to rubber stamp your Backstage POC. But it's important that higher-level Platform goals have been set among VPs and directors with the understanding that a well-constructed developer portal can be the catalyst to achieving not only better developer experience but broader cultural shifts.</p>
<p>Having this kind of executive buy-in means more than just getting stakeholders on board with a portal build or clearing pathways towards Backstage adoption; it also means ensuring they understand the realities of your organization's journey.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-they-prioritize-developer-experience"><strong>3) They prioritize developer experience</strong><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/28/frontside-adopter-post#3-they-prioritize-developer-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3-they-prioritize-developer-experience" title="Direct link to 3-they-prioritize-developer-experience">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Having a dedicated developer experience or DevOps team tasked not only with building out a Backstage instance ‚Äî but with leading adoption ‚Äî is another big factor to success.</p>
<p>Competing platforms are very common at big companies, with many teams doing different things or serving different parts of a business. But developer experience teams usually have a very clear mandate and are often one of the only commonalities between these competing teams. This team should have the bandwidth available to oversee the adoption process from start to finish, and partner with the right folks (research, design, internal comms and marketing) to create an effective adoption plan tailored specifically for a company's needs.</p>
<p>If you don't have ‚Äåestablished developer experience resources in place, then the questions the team leading the Backstage work needs to ask are "what are the common problems to be solved at a platform level?" and "once we've proved our initial use cases, how are we internally evangelizing this amongst our competing teams?"</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-they-collaborate-with-other-platform-teams"><strong>4) They collaborate with other platform teams</strong><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/28/frontside-adopter-post#4-they-collaborate-with-other-platform-teams" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4-they-collaborate-with-other-platform-teams" title="Direct link to 4-they-collaborate-with-other-platform-teams">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>A developer experience team can not single-handedly transform an organization's development structures, processes, and culture. It requires collaboration with teams responsible for other aspects of the platform. Successful adopters collaborate with other teams to bring them along on the journey of improving developer experience. They use Backstage as an opportunity to foster their inner-source contribution practice by allowing multiple platform teams to contribute plugins to their portal.</p>
<p>The developer experience team takes on the role of host in that collaborative process. They support other teams in integrating their features into the portal, provide guidance on best practices, and advocate for the needs of developers.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-they-engage-learn-and-grow-with-the-community"><strong>5) They engage, learn, and grow with the community</strong><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/28/frontside-adopter-post#5-they-engage-learn-and-grow-with-the-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5-they-engage-learn-and-grow-with-the-community" title="Direct link to 5-they-engage-learn-and-grow-with-the-community">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>One of the key benefits of building a developer platform based off an open source framework is leveraging the contributions and best practices from the community. The Backstage community is the largest gathering of developer experience practitioners in the world. There are now <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/63aa3a65ec05f638ba76c06878d6635194620b34/ADOPTERS.md#L4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousands of adopters</a> with a wealth of experience and best practices to learn from ‚Äî and they are excited to share!</p>
<p>By participating in the community, developer experience leaders can learn from their peers at other companies about strategies that work and can keep up with the latest features of the ever-evolving Backstage platform. They're aware of what solutions exist within the open source framework and plugin marketplace as well as what they may need to build in-house.</p>
<p>In short, successful Backstage adopters engage within the Backstage community and their peer group to find solutions that fit their common challenges as well as their unique needs.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/08/stash-adopter-post"/>
        <updated>2023-07-08T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[backstage header]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="backstage header" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/banner-3aedcaa1bd84c0d0e2fa33535f2fc651.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Monitoring the health of a software application goes beyond surfacing API errors and customer-facing issues. It requires a comprehensive understanding of every facet of a service, including process metrics like DORA, as well as clear ownership of services and processes. By implementing Elevate as an internal developer portal, development teams now have better visibility of ownership in the distributed systems they work in. They also have the benefit of consolidated application health data and other metrics gained from the SaaS products they utilize everyday. This approach ensures a ‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù for application ownership and health so our teams can focus on building products and features that help our customers invest for a prosperous future.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>At <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/08/stash.com">Stash</a>, our mission is to give people the confidence to invest for a better life. Our app simplifies investing for the middle class who may be less experienced with traditional investing and retirement planning. Our customers trust us with their money, and with that, rely on us to provide a responsive and quality experience that works every time.</p>
<p>It isn't revolutionary to say that monitoring the health of a software application is critical for ensuring its reliability and performance in service of customers' needs. However, in a distributed architecture like microservices, tracking ownership and monitoring application health across the system quickly becomes complex. The difficulties are further compounded when leveraging multiple SaaS products, which is common in modern development but specifically so for fintechs like Stash that integrate best-of-breed software in novel ways, as we do across our platform.</p>
<p>What we found is that there are ways to make sense of these complex systems by tracking DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics for applications and leveraging SaaS products to create a central hub to understand the <em>true</em> health of an application.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll walk you through Stash's journey to create Elevate, our Internal Developer Portal (IDP) based on the open source <a href="https://backstage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage</a> framework. Our portal increased visibility of application health metrics, prioritized cloud cost insights, and reduced the context switching required for teams to understand service ownership and the components that make up the entirety of Stash's world-class application systems.</p>
<p>Elevate enables effective monitoring, streamlined incident response, improved overall application health, and most importantly, team health.</p>
<p>It seems counterintuitive, but trying to solve the problem of monitoring and tracking ownership with a traditional centralized approach and more SaaS monitoring tools will likely not solve the problem.</p>
<p>Traditional centralized monitoring approaches may not suffice in a distributed architecture due to services that may act as pass-throughs or services that call many other services to aggregate data or tasks. In traditional monitoring, you will only see the error rates and request logging for individual services. That will only ever show you part of the puzzle as you'll still be unable to trace a request from a frontend application, through your many service layers to your data stores and back out.</p>
<p>Utilizing multiple SaaS products for service monitoring and observability during development introduces additional complexity; each product may have its own dashboard and reporting tools. These implementation differences can make it difficult to consolidate and gain a holistic view of the application's health.</p>
<p>Picking the right tool for the job can make developing quality products at speed and scale easier, but what we've learned is that utilizing each tool's context for application health as a piece of the puzzle has exponentially impacted our team's effectiveness.</p>
<p>The team at Stash took an approach of enhanced monitoring which required introducing request tracing for services that a team owns (and the entire org) to get the full picture. We worked to distribute monitoring <strong><em>across</em></strong> services, capturing both customer-facing issues and internal process metrics that focus on service quality.</p>
<p>We also took a hard look at our health metrics. Some attributes of healthy applications are high availability, HTTP 500 errors are minimal, CPU and memory usage are sustainable, and the ‚Äú/health‚Äù endpoint returns the health of the application. However, to gain insights into the true health of an application and the teams supporting it, tracking DORA metrics is essential.</p>
<p>We took four key DORA metrics ‚Äî deployment frequency, lead time for changes, mean time to restore, and change failure rate ‚Äî to process aspects of services and provide a comprehensive understanding of an application's overall health as well as the health of our team and organization.</p>
<h1>Understanding complex systems at Stash with Backstage</h1>
<p>At Stash, we use a multitude of SaaS tools during the software development process, some of which provide varying degrees of built-in service catalogs. With many sources of truth and a lack of ability to combine data from multiple sources (eg. FireHydrant incident response with DataDog or DataDog Real User Monitoring data in PagerDuty, etc.) it was challenging to get a holistic view of the whole system..</p>
<p>Additionally, as we created more and more microservices, it became challenging to determine ownership for each service. Microservice owners were finding it increasingly difficult to keep track of their various consumers to assure that contracts were being maintained as new changes were introduced. Ownership clarity was <strong><em>crucial</em></strong> to our goals for effective monitoring, issue resolution, and maintaining accountability.</p>
<p>To consolidate application health data, simplify support and clarify ownership for those on development teams as well as for those in non-engineering roles, we implemented an instance of Backstage as an internal service catalog we call Elevate.</p>
<p>Utilizing Backstage as a framework, Elevate aims to improve quality and domain expertise for all things code and process at Stash. The key to accomplishing this goal is to leverage the processes and integrations we already use at Stash, but centralize and surface the data in a way that is digestible for engineers and non-engineers alike.</p>
<p>For the benefit of a self-managed internal service catalog to outweigh the change in processes and the cost of the catalog's infrastructure, it had to be easy to adopt and have an enlightening effect on teams.</p>

<p>Elevate acts as a centralized hub for registering services, documenting ownership information, and establishing clear accountability. It provides a holistic view of distributed systems and the shared modules and libraries they use by making it easier to track ownership and ensure effective communication and collaboration.</p>
<p>The Backstage <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Catalog</a> model allows service-level tracking, as well as dashboards for Groups (teams or squads), Systems (business units or focus areas), Domains (organization units) or even company wide.</p>

<p>The Backstage open source plugins provide the nuts and bolts for our internal service catalog functionality. Backstage's community plugins assist with the basics of catalog management. They also allow for dynamically changing the type content based on which entry is being viewed in the catalog (library, service, API, team, etc.). Each view can be custom-tailored with the information for that type of entry, which allows for shared libraries to have an overview page focused on getting engineers to documentation; while the overview page for a deployed service can focus on the current incident status and on-call information as the most important thing. The plugin for searching allows for easy discovery of items or documentation throughout the catalog.</p>

<p>Elevate leverages the CODEOWNERS integration to establish expertise of specific codebases within services and ensure accountability and clarity within the development teams. Codespace ownership is typically defined with required reviewers by code owners and admins that provide additional support, but the CODEOWNERS plugin allows for clarity into who the subject matter expert of the codebase is, not just the administrative owner. The plugin also displays recent changes that have been merged into the codebase, including the authors and approvers of the changes and other valuable metadata.</p>
<p>This improved clarity into contributors and recent contributions can prevent developers and managers from playing telephone when effective communication is crucial to fixing a bug or resolving an incident.</p>

<p>Backstage offers a catalog of integrations with many popular SaaS products. With Elevate, we've integrated plugins for monitoring infrastructure and user experience, visualizing process backlog and bottlenecks, as well as giving insights into data that teams have not yet been able to see for services they support. These integrations allow for seamless data collection and aggregation, transforming Elevate into the centralized hub for application and team health data.</p>
<p>The key to making your service catalog scalable is to ensure you aren't requiring the duplication of data away from its source; Elevate utilizes dashboards and charts to view the data stored in the remote sources. When aggregating DORA metrics we are able to leverage our SaaS tools API within Elevate's service layer to pull data and transform it for our custom dashboards.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="visible-cohesive-monitoring">Visible cohesive monitoring<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/08/stash-adopter-post#visible-cohesive-monitoring" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Visible cohesive monitoring" title="Direct link to Visible cohesive monitoring">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>At Stash, we collect performance metrics, resource utilization, and proactive alerts with DataDog and Sentry; these tools can also monitor and track API errors and customer-facing issues that would normally go undetected. To deliver the best possible experience for Stash's customers, engineers need to be able to easily monitor errors on customer devices to solve issues before they are reported.</p>
<p>Sentry's plugin easily surfaces uncaught errors within services. DataDog's plugin allows for plug-and-play visualizations of charts or graphs to help support services, teams and beyond. Elevate integrates these insights to monitor the overall health of the application.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="centralized-incident-management">Centralized incident management<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/07/08/stash-adopter-post#centralized-incident-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Centralized incident management" title="Direct link to Centralized incident management">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>PagerDuty has been Stash's standard for on-call activities and paging while FireHydrant has more recently been adopted as a part of a more comprehensive incident management process. Together, we use these incident management platforms to establish incident response workflows and communication channels dedicated to each service.</p>
<p>PagerDuty's plugin allows for quick reference to the individual who is actively on-call for a service while FireHydrant's plugin lets you track open incidents that may be impacting a service and even trigger new incidents directly from within the service overview page in Elevate. Integrating these plugins allows Elevate to serve as a centralized location for the incident management process, helping our engineers quickly gather the necessary context of an issue and drive faster resolution.</p>

<p>It's difficult for teams to be more efficient with their infrastructure costs if they are unable to see the problem areas for the services they support, as well as references for effective resource management to model after. The AWS Cost Insights plugin allows Elevate to monitor cost-related metrics and ensure efficient resource allocation and budgeting.</p>
<p>Due to the dynamic nature of how different companies may want to aggregate their cost data, the plugin is mostly frontend visualizations for displaying costs over time with drop-downs for filtering and grouping. In Elevate, we created a custom backend plugin to pull our costs data from AWS and group it properly for presentation to the visualizations.</p>
<p>When we surface this data with the backend layer in Elevate, the frontend is able to surface our AWS cost data to people who previously didn't have access or who found it too difficult to use the more complex AWS Cost Explorer.</p>
<p>In addition to these people now having access to AWS cost data, those with access now get to visualize our spend by AWS product and Stash service. These visualizations are available when looking at a single service, a team or business unit, and organization-wide.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="aws breakdown" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/image6-2d9ffeeac10cc46075f2227c5946cbdc.png" width="1999" height="1026" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p><em>Breakdown of total costs per service across the organization.</em></p>
<p>For those that aren't regularly in AWS Cost Explorer, a benefit of implementing these visualizations is being able to easily see where we have some room for improvement when it comes to tagging our AWS resources. The company-wide breakdown shows all resources, whereas the sub-views rely on resource tagging for service name and team name, so discrepancies may arise which will help you close any gaps in tagging you may have. If resources are not properly tagged, reducing and managing your infrastructure costs will be more time consuming than necessary and much less effective.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, gathering DORA metrics provides important insight into the health of applications and teams, but until we built Elevate, we didn't have a hub at Stash to aggregate and present that data in an easily digestible manner.</p>
<p>Elevate's initial DORA metrics implementation reaches out to the source(s) of truth for each metric and groups and surfaces that in a manner similar to the AWS Cost Insights implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment Frequency</strong> from DataDog ‚Äúdeployment‚Äù indicator for each service</p>
<p><strong>Lead Time for Changes</strong> from GitHub for each repo using commit sha's and releases</p>
<p><strong>Mean Time to Restore</strong> from FireHydrant using their MTTR API for each service</p>
<p><strong>Change Failure Rate</strong> from DataDog and FireHydrant for each service</p>
<p>Elevate implemented the above data sources for our DORA metrics MVP as those have been determined as our best practices for where that information should be tracked, for now.</p>

<p><em>DORA metrics that display on the overview page for each service.</em></p>
<p>Software development has an ever-changing SaaS landscape, so what serves as a best practice today, may not be in a week, a month or a year from now. The tools we use to facilitate a task or automate processes may change, but the metrics we want to track (DORA and others) are much more stable. Surfacing data in easily consumable views within Elevate has decoupled the tool we use to accomplish a task from where we monitor the health of our system and how that tool assists.</p>

<p><em>Separate backend services by metric allow for easy updating for additional or new data sources in the future.</em></p>
<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>Monitoring the health of a software application goes beyond surfacing API errors and customer-facing issues. It requires a comprehensive understanding of every facet of a service, including process metrics like DORA, as well as clear ownership of services and processes. By implementing Elevate as an internal developer portal, development teams now have better visibility of ownership in the distributed systems they work in. They also have the benefit of consolidated application health data and other metrics gained from the SaaS products they utilize everyday. This approach ensures a ‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù for application ownership and health so our teams can focus on building products and features that help our customers invest for a prosperous future.</p>]]></content>

<p>These parts that are wrapped with <code>${{ ‚Ä¶ }}</code> are evaluated by the Software Templates backend plugin.
The template strings provide a rich API that enables template authors to manipulate the parameters provided by users of the templates and to pass the parameters into both the built in filters and custom filters that template authors provided when configuring the plugin.</p>
<p>This templating language is called <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nunjucks</a>, which is based on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jinja2</a>, both of which are popular templating engines.
Under the hood these templating strings compile into JavaScript. The <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a> treats the code provided by the template language as untrusted, so adopters need a safe environment ‚Äì a sandbox ‚Äì to execute the JavaScript in.
Up until the latest Backstage release, that sandbox was <code>vm2</code>. Now, the project is instead using <code>isolated-vm</code> as the sandbox to execute this JavaScript in.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-the-change">Why the change?<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/06/21/switching-out-sandbox#why-the-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why the change?" title="Direct link to Why the change?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>You might have seen over the last few months <a href="https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some advisories and CVEs</a> that were found in the original <a href="https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>vm2</code></a> sandbox that we were using.
Both the <code>vm2</code> maintainers and the Backstage maintainers have been quick at releasing new versions of the sandbox and the Software Templates backend plugin, respectively, to protect their users.</p>
<p>We were recently made aware of another sandbox escape through our HackerOne BugBounty program, with a Proof of Concept using a Software Template.
The maintainers of the <code>vm2</code> project have also been notified. We currently cannot find a simple solution to stop the latest escape. So, In the interest of moving quickly to protect the security of our end-users, we're moving away from that <code>vm2</code> and moving towards <a href="https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>isolated-vm</code></a> instead.</p>
<p><code>vm2</code> has been one of the most popular sandboxes to-date, and we want to thank the <code>vm2</code> maintainers for the recent sandbox escape fixes and getting those shipped as fast as possible.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-this-mean-for-backstage">What does this mean for Backstage?<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/06/21/switching-out-sandbox#what-does-this-mean-for-backstage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What does this mean for Backstage?" title="Direct link to What does this mean for Backstage?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p><code>isolated-vm</code> uses a quite different implementation and security model compared to <code>vm2</code>.</p>
<p>It is a native dependency and executes code in a <code>v8</code> engine so-called <code>isolate</code> instead. This means that by design, it does not have any access to neither the node runtime nor any frameworks on top of <code>v8</code>, which is precisely what we want to ensure in our sandbox.</p>
<p>This method of sandboxing is much more secure than how the <code>vm2</code> sandbox functions, and less prone to escapes.</p>
<p>While we can rest assured that this is a highly secure sandbox, the native dependency might mean there's a little more burden on adopters to install this dependency properly and have the right libraries set up.
This native dependency must be built upon installation, on the exact architecture that it executes on.</p>
<p>For those who compile and run Backstage on stripped-down environments, you will want to ensure that you have the build basics present, e.g. <code>build-essential</code> or similar corresponding to your operating system of choice.
The <code>isolated-vm</code> repo has <a href="https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm#requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some further information</a> about the build environment requirements.</p>
<p>With all that said, we think this tradeoff is worth the effort to ensure better security.</p>

<p>This change comes with the v1.15.0 release of Backstage that was released yesterday, so please make sure you are upgraded to the latest version of Backstage to keep your sandbox environments secure.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Backstage released a new CLI earlier this year as part of a <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage-deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Backstage project</a>. This new capability allows early adopters to deploy their Backstage proof of concept faster than before. In this blog, you‚Äôll learn a little bit more about the Deploy CLI and how you can get started with it.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-backstage-deploy">Why Backstage Deploy<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/05/06/backstage-deploy-alpha#why-backstage-deploy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Backstage Deploy" title="Direct link to Why Backstage Deploy">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>We‚Äôve heard from Backstage adopters that before reaching widespread adoption at their organizations, teams test out a Backstage proof of concept (POC). To create the POC, teams scaffold an instance, set up the catalog, and change the UI to suit their company‚Äôs branding. Once these milestones are completed, there's just one last step before showing off the awesomeness of a Backstage POC internally... deploying the Backstage POC from a local machine to the cloud. This final step often introduces a lot of questions that attempt to determine the easiest and fastest way to do that.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre at this last step: your POC is ready for deployment, but you have some lingering questions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Dockerfile should you use?</li>
<li>Should the POC be deployed on Kubernetes?</li>
<li>How do you deploy the POC on my cloud provider?</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these questions and reduce friction from deploying a POC, we built a <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage-deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new CLI</a>. The CLI is simply called <code>deploy</code> and is invokable with <code>npx</code>. With this new CLI, you can generate a Dockerfile and deploy a Backstage instance onto a preferred cloud provider. While the package‚Äôs infrastructure is built to support all cloud providers, currently the CLI only offers an AWS implementation. In the future, we plan to add additional cloud providers to the package and <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/6996b3338d678efc03307112524060e9dc2ad769/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">welcome any contributions</a> extending the suite of cloud provider implementations!</p>
<p><strong>So, what about Kubernetes?</strong> Since the CLI is designed specifically for the POC phase, we believe that Kubernetes isn‚Äôt the right fit ‚Äì as Kubernetes is better suited for production workloads. So, we explored lightweight, container-based solutions, and landed on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Lightsail</a> as a hosting service for the POC.
Amazon Lightsail supports <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-container-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lightweight container</a> deployments <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at a low cost</a>, and has a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/?loc=ft#AWS_Free_Tier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free trial for new users</a>! Given Lightsail‚Äôs ease of use and affordability, we recommend using Lightsail over Kubernetes to test out your Backstage POC.</p>
<p>With the Dockerfile and Kubernetes questions answered, we just have to address how to actually deploy the POC. And that is where the new CLI comes in.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="get-started-with-deploy-cli">Get started with Deploy CLI<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/05/06/backstage-deploy-alpha#get-started-with-deploy-cli" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Get started with Deploy CLI" title="Direct link to Get started with Deploy CLI">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>It's now time to put the Deploy CLI into action and deploy a Backstage POC. The following steps guide you through the deployment process.</p>
<p>Deploy CLI makes use of <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulumi</a> which is an infrastructure-as-code tool that helps provision resources in the cloud. Before you get started, ensure you have the <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulumi CLI</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CLI</a> installed on your local machine.</p>
<p>You can find the step-by-step installation documentation for Pulumi under the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/deployment/backstage-deploy/aws-lightsail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deployment section</a>.</p>
<p>But we summarize the steps to deploy your POC here. You can invoke the the CLI you can use the following command:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#9CDCFE;--prism-background-color:#232323"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#232323"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">$ npx backstage-deploy aws --create-dockerfile</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">Starting Pulumi</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">successfully initialized stack</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">installing aws plugin</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(212, 212, 212)">..</span><span class="token plain">.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">plugins installed</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">setting up config</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">refreshing stack</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(212, 212, 212)">..</span><span class="token plain">.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">Refreshing </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(212, 212, 212)">(</span><span class="token plain">backstage</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(212, 212, 212)">)</span><span class="token plain">:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">Instance will live at:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#9CDCFE"><span class="token plain">https://backstage-container-service.xxx.us-east-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Once you kick off the command it will create a Dockerfile for you in the root and Pulumi will start provisioning resources in AWS.
Pulumi will then create a container based deployment in Amazon Lightsail.</p>
<p>After you‚Äôre done with the POC, it‚Äôs easy to delete the AWS resources you provisioned and save you costs within AWS. You can do so with the following command:</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier in this blog, we released the Backstage Deploy CLI with an AWS implementation only. In the next few months, we are excited to collect feedback from our end users to understand how the AWS implementation works. With those learnings, we plan to iterate on the Deploy CLI and build out implementations for other cloud providers. Of course, contributions are always welcome!</p>
<p>So, please try this new CLI out and let us know what you think on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/995973463208644678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>!</p>

<p>We had a blast talking all things Backstage at KubeCon EU 2023 in Amsterdam last week. In case you missed it, here‚Äôs a quick recap:</p>

<p>On Tuesday the Backstage maintainers hosted a jam-packed project meeting. The community welcomed many teams and individuals that were early in their Backstage journey, either actively adopting, preparing for the POC phase, or learning about the capabilities of Backstage. Many of the newcomers were eager to learn about how Backstage could help streamline their development workflows and improve developer productivity. During the project meeting, the maintainers covered a ‚Äúday in the life‚Äù of a core maintainer, walked through spinning up a new instance of Backstage in a live demo, and opened it up to questions from the community. It‚Äôs super exciting to see so much growing interest in Backstage and all of the ways adopters are adapting it to their needs.</p>

<p>Core maintainers <a href="https://github.com/benjdlambert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Lambert</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Rugvip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrik Oldsberg</a> took center stage on Wednesday for the Backstage Maintainer Track: State of Backstage in 2023 talk. Backstage has officially hit over 1,000 adopters and 1,000 contributors ‚Äì so it‚Äôs apt timing to modernize the governance model for the project. Taking pointers from the <a href="https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF Contributor Ladder Governance Template</a>, a new <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Governance Model</a> is now in effect! Patrik walked us through the new ladder model which introduces a number of changes, one being the addition of <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#project-area-maintainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project area maintainers</a>. This role lets members of the community take increased ownership over a specific area of interest, like Catalog, Discoverability, TechDocs, Helm Charts, and Kubernetes. New project areas that will be added include Permissions and Software Templates. New project areas can be proposed by nominating a project area maintainer for the area. The new model also adds an organization member role for contributors who want to take a more active role in the Backstage community. You can open an issue to become an organization member <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ben and Patrik also covered new capabilities for Software Templates and framework updates. Lots of exciting new features are planned for Software Templates including a new UI, async validation for CustomFieldExtensions, and embedded workflows. Lastly, the maintainers also announced a new focus on declarative integration ‚Äì permitting plugin installation without TypeScript. Development is still early, but we can‚Äôt wait to see this in action!</p>

<p>Throughout the week, we also heard success stories of adopters, like AppsFlyer‚Äôs talk, ‚ÄúHow We Migrated Over 1000 Services to Backstage Using GitOps and Survived to Talk About It!‚Äù AppsFlyer has over 1,000 services and processes over 200 billion events per day ‚Äì so migrating to Backstage as their service catalog platform was no small feat. As part of their migration, they also integrated GitOps and Terraform into their Backstage instance. Many attendees found interest in these case studies where you could see the adoption and POC process directly from other adopters. It was exciting to see firsthand how teams can extend Backstage to fit their needs on the fly.</p>
<p>We were thrilled to see so much excitement and interest brewing around Backstage this year! If you missed it, you can catch up as soon as more talks are added to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cncf/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF YouTube channel</a>. We can‚Äôt wait to catch up with you all again soon at KubeCon North America in Chicago.</p>]]></content>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Spotify released Backstage into open source three years ago today. Since then, the community has grown by leaps and bounds to stretch across the globe (and the Discord server!). Now that Backstage is a threenager, the growing pains are real. So, on this birthday, we want to cover our collective efforts to make it easier to adopt and contribute to Backstage.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="they-grow-up-so-fast-dont-they">They grow up so fast, don‚Äôt they?<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/03/15/backstage-turns-3#they-grow-up-so-fast-dont-they" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to They grow up so fast, don‚Äôt they?" title="Direct link to They grow up so fast, don‚Äôt they?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Happy birthday, Backstage! Three years ago, Spotify released its homegrown developer portal into the wild after a small team collaborated on an internal Hack Week project. We‚Äôd had a lot of conversations with companies looking to build out something similar to what we‚Äôd been running for years, so our Hack Week sprint started as an experiment to see if the Backstage core plugins could be valuable in open source.</p>
<p>It's clich√© at this point ‚Äî because we‚Äôve said it a million times ‚Äî&nbsp;but no one could have predicted what came next.</p>
<p>In three short years, Backstage has grown to a Cloud Native Computing Foundation Incubating project, with more than 900 adopters and 1000+ contributors worldwide. Companies like CVS Health, Siemens, LinkedIn, REI, Vodafone, and Lego are building out their own developer portals from the Backstage framework and bringing their learnings to the project.</p>
<p>A few more stats we love to see (mainly coming from the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project repo</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>3k+ project forks</li>
<li>38k+ commits</li>
<li>12k+ PRs</li>
<li>15k+ total contributions</li>
<li>21k+ stars on GitHub</li>
<li>9k+ Discord members</li>
<li>100+ open source plugins in the <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plugin marketplace</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But, without a doubt, the best thing about the Backstage project is the people in this community. People who are curious, collaborative, and excited to share knowledge. People who‚Äôll sift through Discord at all hours to answer questions and support one another. People who come from all over the world but share a common trait: being passionate about enabling developers to do their best work.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt take our word for it! Take a look at this birthday video we put together with a few community members.</p>
<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;width:100%;height:100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rllOa_MfEWw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-growing-pains-are-real">The growing pains are real<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/03/15/backstage-turns-3#the-growing-pains-are-real" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The growing pains are real" title="Direct link to The growing pains are real">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>But it's not all sunshine and roses in Backstage-land. If Year 1 was about getting this community going and Year 2 was focused on maturing the platform, then Year 3 needs to address some of the inevitable growing pains a project undergoes as it gains ground.</p>
<p>We hear two things pretty consistently from the community:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backstage is a steep learning curve:</strong> Over the past three years, the project has grown in scope and breadth which can translate to complexity. This is especially true for newcomers looking to get their arms wrapped around the key concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Backstage has barriers to adoption:</strong> Backstage adopters tell us driving widespread adoption of their developer portal remains the biggest challenge they face. Adoption barriers can be technical but are often cultural.</li>
</ul>
<p>The maintainers and some of our most involved community members are actively tackling how we can make the Backstage onboarding process easier for contributors. There are also lots of ways the project could better support adopters on that journey and make adoption faster and smoother.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre looking at everything from cleaning up documentation to opinionated catalog ingestors being discussed in both the Catalog and Adoption monthly SIGs (running meeting notes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xg57CDfX2R5jTGbbWANzifm2szEb664kuTwfEEvKgZU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zeYSzXYgh897bxPQmwy2btOwCFlEjlUDLf00riySLRc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). A few priorities that we‚Äôve already mapped out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier to install, customize, and maintain Backstage</li>
<li>Provide Golden Paths for adoption</li>
<li>Improve the experience and the content on <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backstage.io</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are now so many mature adopters ‚Äî Spotify included ‚Äî there‚Äôs so much knowledge on how to create a roadmap for adoption and use cases, how to roll out your developer portal to your teams and drive inner source contributions, how to measure and attribute developer productivity gains, etc.</p>
<p>Our goal is to tap into the knowledge those adopters have gained and create more tangible resources for the entire community. But we can‚Äôt do it without help. And that‚Äôs where you come in!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-more-involved">Getting (more) involved<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/03/15/backstage-turns-3#getting-more-involved" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting (more) involved" title="Direct link to Getting (more) involved">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>We‚Äôre very grateful for the Backstage ride-or-dies: the contributors who show up to every community session, attend every SIG, and are always ready to jump in on any PR or issue.</p>
<p>But one of the areas where we think the project could greatly improve (and better address some of the growing pains I mentioned above!) is more active contribution ‚Äî both the total number of people contributing and what they‚Äôre contributing.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve already shared a bit on this but the maintainer team is starting to address this challenge by proposing the following three initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce more steps in between first-time contributor and maintainer in the form of a contributor ladder (loosely based on the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/project-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF Project Template</a>).</li>
<li>Change the ownership model, for example, divide the project up into several project areas, each covering particular parts of the project.</li>
<li>Introduce a new process for large contributions in the form of Backstage Enhancement Proposals (BEPs).</li>
</ul>
<p>These two RFCs on <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updated Backstage Governance</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Enhancement Proposals</a> remain open so feel free to read and join the discussion! Watch this space as we‚Äôll share more on the go-forward governance and BEPs plan soon.</p>
<p>But if you‚Äôre brand-new and just looking to get your feet wet, we‚Äôve also <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/getting-involved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compiled some small steps</a> you can take to get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report (or squash) bugs: Look through the GitHub issues for <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/bug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bugs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/good%20first%20issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good first issues</a> or <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/help%20wanted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help wanted</a></li>
<li>Build or suggest a plugin: The Backstage project grows with every new plugin that gets added</li>
<li>Add non-code contributions: We welcome things that help the community at large, but may not fit into the scope of the core project</li>
<li>Write documentation or improve the website: The current documentation and project site are pretty limited. Better content helps a lot of those growing pains.</li>
<li>Contribute to Storybook: Help us <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/help%20wanted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create new components</a> or improve stories for the existing ones</li>
<li>Submit feedback: The best way to send feedback is to file <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an issue</a> with as much detail as possible</li>
<li>Add your company to ADOPTERS: Adding your company to <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADOPTERS</a> really helps the project, you can do this by filling out this <a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/zcOaKikB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adopter form</a></li>

<p>UPDATE: The backend system is now released! See <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.18.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the v1.18 release notes</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the past year, the Backstage maintainer team has been spending time to give the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/backend-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old Backstage backend system</a> a much needed revamp. Our goal was not to build something completely new from scratch, but rather to solidify the existing foundations that have grown organically. We wanted to make plugin installation a lot simpler, while maintaining and even improving the ways in which you can customize your backend setups.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre happy to announce that the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.11.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v1.11</a> release includes the public alpha of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Backstage backend system</a>! The system has already been available to use for some time, as some of you have already found, but this alpha release marks the point where we are finally ready to encourage widespread adoption by plugin builders. We still don‚Äôt recommend that you use this new system in your production setups just yet, more on that later.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history-of-the-backstage-backend-system">History of the Backstage backend system<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha#history-of-the-backstage-backend-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History of the Backstage backend system" title="Direct link to History of the Backstage backend system">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The backend system that we all use today has grown very organically based on all the needs that have been discovered along the journey of the Backstage Open Source project. We started out with a very flexible system that was essentially just a collection of recommended patterns for plugins, along with a couple of common interfaces and utilities. This was largely due to the fact that before it was open sourced, the Backstage backend services at Spotify were all built on top of internal frameworks and practices that we couldn‚Äôt bring with us. Back in 2020, we didn‚Äôt have a lot of knowledge about what a good backend system for Backstage would look like, so we started off with a highly flexible foundation that would evolve organically over time.</p>
<p>As Backstage grew across all dimensions of adopter count, community size, code size, and capability, we saw the need to take a step back and reevaluate how Backstage backend plugins are built. About one year ago, the maintainers sat down and started to sketch what a new backend system could look like.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="designing-the-new-system">Designing the New System<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha#designing-the-new-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Designing the New System" title="Direct link to Designing the New System">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>When we set out on this project, we had a few primary goals. First, we intended to introduce as few new concepts as possible. Our existing system already had a lot of different patterns, and ideally we wanted to only give those patterns names and make them part of the framework. Second, we wanted to keep the backend system recognizable to those familiar with the frontend system. The list of goals goes on, we had a lot of reasons to build this new system, these are a few more important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier to create and maintain backend installations.</li>
<li>Align how plugins provide points of customization and how those customizations are installed.</li>
<li>Make it much easier to maintain plugins, in particular keeping the API stable.</li>
<li>Improve the local development and testing experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prioritizing simplicity is often a guiding principle that we use for designs that span multiple ownership roles. We decide on which parts of the system that we think are the most important to have as simple as possible, or, viewed from the opposite end, where in the system we put necessary complexity. In this case, we optimized for keeping the backend setup as simple as possible, followed by modules and plugins, then libraries, and lastly the framework itself. What this guidance means in practice is that when there is complexity that needs to be added to implement a certain feature, we place as much of it as possible within the framework itself, then libraries, plugins and modules, and if absolutely needed, the backend setup.</p>
<p>To get the Backstage backend system to where we are today, we went through three major stages, starting with some very early high level experimentation. If you‚Äôre a fan of Git archaeology, you can see some of our early ideas in <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/fd3e6b67fef25a04789779700db4c37047d59d1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our experiments branch</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backend-system-exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate repository</a> that we used to explore different ideas together with <a href="https://roadie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roadie</a>. The output of this work was all presented in an <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/11611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC</a> to gather feedback.</p>
<p>A few months later as the RFC settled, we resumed work and followed up with an initial implementation. At this point there were still a lot of details in the design to figure out, especially as we started looking at how our existing plugins and services fit into this new system. We identified a lot of aspects that we inevitably didn‚Äôt consider in the initial design, and started exploring technical solutions to those problems. There was a lot of zooming in and out, both implementing details and then stepping back and looking at how that affects the broader system and where to go next. This ended up being the most time consuming stage, and we spent several months iterating on this.</p>
<p>We wrapped up this work just before KubeCon NA 2022, with the full system implemented. The state of the system at this point was presented in our talk on the topic, which you can see just below. Except for a few API tweaks, this is what the system still looks like today.</p>

<br>
<p>The final stage was all about polish, which we picked up at the beginning of this year. By leaving a bit of space between the main implementation, or phase two, and the polish phase, phase three, it was much easier to properly scrutinize our past solutions. We forget a lot of the low level reasoning for changes, and it is easier to step back and reconsider parts of the system. For example, we found that our initial design of the <code>createServiceFactory</code> function was unnecessarily complex, and could be made much simpler for most usages. In addition to reviewing all the APIs, we also wrote more documentation to help users, ensured that the local development and testing experience was solid, and double checked that there was a smooth migration path from the old system.</p>

<p>Now that you‚Äôve learned about the journey of designing the new system, let‚Äôs review the new architecture. This blog includes a brief introduction to the architecture of the new system. If you want to dive deeper, check out our <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architecture documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The backend system has five major building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backend instances act as dependency injection containers and are the unit of deployment in which you install plugins and modules that you want to use.</li>
<li>Plugins implement the actual features and main business logic, for example the service catalog.</li>
<li>Services provide shared utilities for plugins to use, for example logging, database access, and serving HTTP. Services are provided by the backend and can be customized in each backend instance.</li>
<li>Extension Points serve as an optional API surface for plugins to provide deeper customization, such as installing custom processors in the catalog. It is up to each plugin to define their own extension points.</li>
<li>Modules extend individual plugins with additional features by interacting with the extension points that the plugins expose. A module might for example implement a single entity provider for the catalog.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="benefits-of-the-new-system">Benefits of the New System<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha#benefits-of-the-new-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefits of the New System" title="Direct link to Benefits of the New System">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>This new system reduced the size of a typical backend installation from hundreds of lines of code to just about two dozen, more than an order of magnitude. This reduction comes from shifting complexity away from the backend installation and into the plugins, services, and the backend system itself. Not only does this make a typical backend setup much easier to maintain, but it also makes it much easier to build plugins and modules, and leaves fewer patterns to be unnecessarily invented.</p>
<p>As part of this shift, we‚Äôve moved many concepts from being coding patterns to being features built into the framework. This will allow us to further evolve the backend system in much more interesting ways, and still bring along the entire Backstage plugin ecosystem. It also helps align Backstage plugins around a couple of extensibility patterns, rather than each plugin having their own bespoke patterns for how extensions are installed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alpha-what-does-it-mean">Alpha, what does it mean?<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha#alpha-what-does-it-mean" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alpha, what does it mean?" title="Direct link to Alpha, what does it mean?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>With the release of the backend system into alpha, we are confident enough in the design of the system that we encourage plugin owners to add support for the new system in their plugins. This means following the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/migrating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plugin migration guide</a> and exporting a plugin instance. Do not remove support for the old system yet ‚Äì keep your existing <code>createRouter</code> export intact.</p>
<p>While we encourage migration of plugins, we do not yet recommend migrating your backend installations to the new system. We want to create space to gather and address feedback from the plugin migration experience, and to make changes if necessary.</p>
<p>If you are worried about the upcoming backend migration, you can <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-backends/migrating#migrating-the-index-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take a peek</a> at our <code>legacyPlugin</code> helper. It allows you to forklift over all existing plugin setups to the new backend system, and then migrate plugins one by one.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-steps">Next Steps<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha#next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next Steps" title="Direct link to Next Steps">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>During the next release we will keep working on migrating the core plugins, as well as addressing any feedback that we receive. We don‚Äôt want to rush a stable release though, and won‚Äôt encourage broad adoption until we‚Äôre confident that we won‚Äôt have to follow it up with immediate breaking changes. Yet, we are excited about where we are today, and are looking forward to the future stable release!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Fewer ‚Äúvibes‚Äù and more climbs (up the contribution ladder)" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/whats-ahead-4348653ceceacc6df045883d0d479a5d.png" width="2500" height="1313" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Okay, everyone. Time to move on from all the 2022 reflections, Top 10 lists, and Wrapped(s), and turn our gaze in the other direction ‚Äî towards 2023. As the Backstage team moves into the new year, we find ourselves asking those perennial questions: How can we continue to grow and enhance the Backstage community? How can we improve the experience for those adopting Backstage? How can we give the best support to Backstage contributors?</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Well, we don‚Äôt have all the answers, but we do have some. So we wanted to share more on three ongoing initiatives aimed at moving the needle forward for these three distinct, yet interrelated, questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow your influence by climbing the contribution ladder</li>
<li>Come join our SIGs (and push for new ones)</li>
<li>Work with us to drive a better experience for Backstage adopters</li>
</ul>
<h1>Climb the contribution ladder</h1>
<p>Truth be told, we‚Äôve been wanting to grow the maintainer team for some time, and have had multiple requests from contributors and contributing organizations wanting to become maintainers. But, so far, we just haven‚Äôt managed to get anything off the ground. What we see is that becoming a maintainer is too hard and the current ownership model doesn‚Äôt work. In short, we need to update Backstage governance.</p>
<p>To address this, we are proposing (RFC links below) the following three initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce more steps in between first-time contributor and maintainer in the form of a contributor ladder (loosely based on the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/project-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF Project Template</a>). The ladder might look as follows: Contributor, Org Member, Reviewer, Maintainer, Project Maintainer.</li>
<li>Change the ownership model, for example, divide the project up into several project areas, each covering particular parts of the project.</li>
<li>Introduce a new process for large contributions in the form of Backstage Enhancement Proposals (BEPs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more and join the already rich discussion in <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC: Updated Backstage Governance</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC: Backstage Enhancement Proposals</a>. The RFC will be open until 13/02/2023.</p>
<h1>Come join our SIGs (and push for new ones)</h1>
<p>As many of you know, SIG stands for Special Interest Group. The purpose of a SIG is to bring together maintainers and interested contributors within a certain specialist area to discuss, debate, spread knowledge, brainstorm - and drive the overall project forward. They‚Äôre also a lot of fun!</p>
<p>We currently have two SIGs up and running:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/sigs/sig-catalog?utm_campaign=Newsletters%20Sent&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=241130993&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fx-nTmQga2j12NqzZaL-lYPq-xQjDoXcWKe_JUoa2RGlK65R9j0CIygfYILr0tGEQSvRVN9xzhiJ6LmVxBthKnStfSA&amp;utm_content=241130993&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalog</a> started up last June and covers all aspects of the systems and components related to the Software Catalog. The group runs every second Tuesday between 16:00 and 17:00 CET. Just show up or hop into <a href="https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/923144214580191282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#catalog</a> (Discord), if you want to talk to us first.

In the first two meetups, we discussed adoption challenges based on user persona, collecting data about those challenges, and bootstrapping the Catalog to improve metadata quality for adopters. This one runs every second Thursday between 16:00 and 17:00 CET. Again just show up or, if you want to talk to us first, you can do so in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/1045031039061479536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#adoption</a> (Discord).

</ul>
<p>So that‚Äôs SIGs. Get involved and join the ones we have up and running. And/or feel free to propose new ones.</p>
<h1>Help drive a better experience for all adopters</h1>
<p>Throughout all stages of adopting Backstage in an organization ‚Äî initial discovery, evaluation and POC, and scaling to the wider org ‚Äî we have identified opportunities where we want to make the journey for Backstage adopters faster and smoother.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll go step-by-step, but initial plans are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier to install, customize, and maintain Backstage</li>
<li>Provide Golden Paths for adoption</li>
<li>Improve the experience and the content on <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backstage.io</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As we move forward, we‚Äôd love you to be part of it. Here are some ways that you can contribute to this initiative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply give us feedback. <a href="https://spotify.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cuxhYPB6oQDu7gW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tell us about your adoption journey</a>.</li>
<li>Contribute to the pages and documentation on <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backstage.io</a></li>

Backstage inspects and transforms an organization's disparate software services and parts into a centralized data store. This blog post introduces the concept of incremental entity providers, which allow Backstage to scale ingestion to even larger datasets.</p>

<!-- -->
<p>A common use case is for an organization to want to surface ownership and metadata about repositories. Backstage provides a mechanism for discovering and transforming repository information into a standard data structure and persisting it into the Backstage <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalog</a>. This process is known as ingestion, where all data is transformed into a standard Backstage data structure known as an entity. Entities in the Catalog‚Äôs data store are accessible to the Backstage App via the REST API.</p>
<p>Data is transformed into entities via what is known as the ingestion and processing loop, which can be thought of as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extract, transform and load (ETL) pipeline</a>, where raw data such as GitHub repositories are loaded from GitHub, transformed into entities and outputted to the Catalog.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="entity-providers">Entity Providers<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/01/31/incremental-entity-provider#entity-providers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Entity Providers" title="Direct link to Entity Providers">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Backstage offers what are known as <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/life-of-an-entity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entity providers</a> as a means for ingesting the raw data into the pipeline and transforming them into Backstage entities. For example, Backstage comes with a <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/reference/plugin-catalog-backend-module-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Entity Provider</a> that finds all catalog-info.yaml files in GitHub repositories. The processing loop transforms them into Backstage entities and subsequently persists them to the software catalog.</p>
<p>Entity providers are a relatively new abstraction and the recommended way to ingest data into the catalog. The Backstage catalog engine starts each registered entity provider, which connects to its data source (e.g., the GitHub Entity Provider connects to GitHub). The entity provider will query the external data source and convert the data into the entity format. Finally, the entity provider issues what is known as a mutation to the catalog engine. A mutation is a signal from the entity provider to the catalog engine that entities are available to be processed and stored.</p>
<p>A mutation can be either a full mutation or a delta mutation. A full mutation replaces all entities previously ingested by the entity provider with a new set of entities. The entity provider will remove all entities not found in the latest ingestion. A full mutation can be used to ingest relatively small datasets (less than 10,000 entities); however, ingesting more during a full ingestion may cause out-of-memory errors and delay the processing of entities from other entity providers. A delta mutation can surgically add and remove entities from the catalog. A delta mutation is useful when the data source provides events-based APIs like webhooks, which allows the Backstage catalog engine to ingest a small number of entities as they get added, updated and/or deleted.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="incremental-entity-providers">Incremental entity providers<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/01/31/incremental-entity-provider#incremental-entity-providers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Incremental entity providers" title="Direct link to Incremental entity providers">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>A large organization typically deals with massive datasets. Until recently, ingesting large datasets with entity providers has been problematic because performing a full ingestion resulted in out-of-memory errors, and many data sources don‚Äôt provide webhooks or other events-based APIs. At the same time, the datasets were too large to efficiently manage through targeted delta mutations.</p>
<p>This is a problem that <a href="http://hp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevEx team at HP</a> faced when building their software catalog with Backstage. <a href="https://github.com/dekoding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damon Kaswell</a>, Senior Application Developer on the DevEx team at HP, shared their experience at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qHyZntKXRU&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf&amp;index=13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BackstageCon 2022</a>, detailing the problem and the solution that <a href="https://frontside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontside</a> created in collaboration with developers on HP‚Äôs DevEx team.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Damon Kaswell" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/damon-32d83539fe147296dc9e4b3c3bcab6ff.jpg" width="204" height="224" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The solution HP and <a href="https://frontside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontside</a> arrived at was to implement an incremental entity provider. An incremental entity provider effectively performs a full mutation using a series of delta mutations combined with a mark and sweep mechanism. It paginates through the dataset, tracking entities retrieved from each page and the cursor of the next page, pausing ingestion every few seconds to give the processing loop time to process existing entities. Once it reaches the end of the dataset, it determines which entities were not ingested during this ingestion cycle and emits a delta mutation to delete unmarked entities.</p>
<p>Simply by adding a few new tables to the database schema, the incremental ingestion entity provider converts any existing entity provider into an incremental entity provider. These tables allow the incremental entity provider to be long-lived and keep track of its current location in the dataset by persisting a cursor that it uses to page through any large dataset. The larger the dataset, the more pages of data or bursts of work the incremental entity provider will ingest‚Äîbut there will be no out-of-memory errors, effectively removing scalability problems.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves. Migrating from regular entity providers to incremental entity providers reduced ingestion time by 92% ‚Äì from over 4 and a half hours to just 20 minutes. Incremental entity providers eliminated the ingestion maintenance burden from being a constant problem to a non-issue. Writing reliable integration with external services can now be done in days instead of weeks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="go-forth-and-ingest">Go forth and ingest!<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2023/01/31/incremental-entity-provider#go-forth-and-ingest" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Go forth and ingest!" title="Direct link to Go forth and ingest!">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Backstage provides a robust framework for ingesting data from external sources, but HP needed to scale it beyond its design. The Backstage framework allowed <a href="https://frontside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontside</a> and HP‚Äôs developers to extend it with a plugin to support HP‚Äôs scaling requirements.</p>
<p>We're delighted to share that as of <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/14356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this PR</a>, the incremental ingestion backend is available for anyone to use with Backstage. The solution was released open source as <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion#backstageplugin-catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion</a> and contains a package for creating incremental entity providers. The plugin's <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository README</a> has detailed configuration and usage outlined.</p>
<p>The incremental ingestion entity provider is an excellent addition to the Backstage stack. Battle-tested on large datasets, the incremental entity provider is a significant step forward in smoothing the path to successful ingestion at scale.</p>]]></content>

<p>If 2021 was the year of growth for the Backstage project and community, 2022 can be easily defined as the year of maturity. Both the project and the community continued to grow at an incredible pace and the platform is now more stable, more secure, and more powerful than ever.</p>
<p>Our community is full of people from across the globe who bring incredible engagement and positive vibes to the project. And we finally got to experience this for the first time in real life during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BackstageCon</a>, the very first in-person conference fully dedicated to Backstage, where hundreds of enthusiasts, the maintainers, adopters, and partners joined the event confirming the great momentum and the traction in the market.</p>
<p>But before anticipating too much, let‚Äôs share some stats of this amazing 2022.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-grew--a-lot">We grew ‚Ä¶ a lot!<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/12/19/backstage-wrapped-2022#we-grew--a-lot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to We grew ‚Ä¶ a lot!" title="Direct link to We grew ‚Ä¶ a lot!">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Last year we celebrated 75 <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public adopters</a> and today we have over 600 adopters, confirming the interest around Backstage across all the industries, sectors, and dimensions. Companies like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/toyota-ecs-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyota North America</a>, Deutsche Bank, Mercedes-Benz, Procter &amp; Gamble, Siemens, LinkedIn, and many more joined the community this year and are actively contributing in growing the product and its maturity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Accelerated growth of Public Backstage Adopters, from January 2021‚ÄìDecember 2022." src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/public-backstage-adopters-2022-f056f7ce7232497865c0855adfbb43db.png" width="703" height="650" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Not only are our adopters growing at an exponential rate, but so too are our contributors. Our <a href="https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673-687207715902193673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> is a perfect example of the worlds of our adopters and contributors melding. On average, at any given hour of the day or night, there are more than 500 people online available to talk and provide support on any Backstage topic. Discord discussions run a full gamut of topics ‚Äì from technical support questions to best practices for onboarding engineers to Backstage ‚Äì basically, anything and everything an adopter may be interested to know and learn. At the very beginning of 2022, we ‚Äúonly‚Äù had 4k Discord members. Today, we have a growing membership of 8.2k.</p>
<p>Isn‚Äôt it what we can call a great and vibrant community of enthusiasts?</p>
<p>The growth of the ecosystem is not limited to the adopters and contributors. The ecosystem also includes big tech companies interested in growing Backstage by including it as part of their offering and integrations. Our <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=GAzKCQO8Vt0&amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collaboration with VMWare</a> is a great example of this, and <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/24/red-hat-joins-backstageio-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedHat</a> joined the party this year ‚Äì promising even faster growth in contributions and integrations for the Backstage project.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let‚Äôs take a quick look at some more numbers, mainly coming from the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Official Github repository</a>. This year‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>Our contributors grew from a group of 500 to 900+</li>
<li>Contributions to the project increased from 9k to 15k+</li>
<li>The number of forks shot up from 2k to 3k+</li>
<li>Backstage stars increased from 14k to almost 20k</li>
<li>And lastly, we welcomed over 550 adopters into our community.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these people driving the enormous growth and maturity of the project are represented in the chart below, which shows cumulative activities per month for Backstage:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Main Github metrics for Backstage.io." src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/github-metrics-for-backstage-io-4ed381120c048a4b704002cf25e1dc60.png" width="1503" height="742" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Wow‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a lot of activity. We‚Äôve generated this animation showing all of your contributions to the Backstage repository in 2022, look at this project grow:</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/12/19/backstage-wrapped-2022#but-wait-theres-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to But wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more" title="Direct link to But wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The growth of the community is so exciting to see. And with all this community growth, comes growth and maturity of the product, making Backstage better able to support adopters in their developer experience challenges. The Backstage open source project has almost <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 plugins</a>, each one amending Backstage with a tool or service to improve not only adopters‚Äô Backstage apps, but their unique developer experiences. And almost every week we learn of a new one being contributed, which is amazing.</p>
<p>The Backstage platform itself is leaving 2022 more mature than ever, thanks to milestones such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/03/17/backstage-1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage is now beyond version 1</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/08/23/backstage-security-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage had its first Security Audit ever and now can rely on a Threat Model</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Learn helps adopters get started more easily</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage reached incubating status as part of the CNCF ecosystem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And like every mature project, now Backstage has also a mascot: Bowie the Beaver!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Bowie the Beaver." src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/bowie-the-beaver-89c87356569e8a887ee918e4c67b27ac.png" width="432" height="386" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Additionally, we launched a new <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/sigs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Special Interest Groups (SIGs)</a> initiative this year, following the lead of Kubernetes. We believe Backstage SIGs will better coordinate contributions, grow the platform cohesively with the open source community, and allow contributors to dig even deeper as a community member. At this moment in time there two SIGs in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/sigs/sig-catalog/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalog SIG</a>, covering all aspects of the systems and components related to the Software Catalog.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/sigs/sig-adoption/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adoption SIG</a>, covering all aspects of the adoption journey of Backstage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our plan is to open more SIGs in 2023 to engage more with the community and to keep driving towards cohesive growth for the community and project.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we mustn't overlook the first ever conference fully dedicated to Backstage: BackstageCon. What was special there? SO much. But in particular two things: seeing everyone in real life and the incredible mood and conversations between maintainers, adopters, partners and enthusiasts. It‚Äôs hard to express just how positive and amazing the vibes were in a blog, but you can read our recap <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/10/28/backstagecon-kubecon-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> or watch the sessions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. And in the meantime, here are some great numbers from the event:</p>
<ul>
<li>250 attendees or a 100% full venue and packed room.</li>
<li>14 sessions</li>
<li>17 speakers</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="goodbye-2022-hello-2023">Goodbye, 2022. Hello, 2023!<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/12/19/backstage-wrapped-2022#goodbye-2022-hello-2023" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Goodbye, 2022. Hello, 2023!" title="Direct link to Goodbye, 2022. Hello, 2023!">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>After this incredible year, thanks to everyone in the global Backstage community who contributed to the open source project in 2022. We are already working on the goals for 2023 ‚Äì and as a roadmap teaser: we are very much committed to making the journey of adoption easier, faster, more valuable, and overall better. We would not be here today without our amazing community, so thank you for everything!</p>
<p>Looking forward to continuing collaborating together for an exciting 2023.</p>
<p>See you then! Happy holidays from everyone on the Backstage team at Spotify!</p>]]></content>

<p>What an action-packed and memorable week for the Backstage community meeting up IRL at KubeCon North America 2022 in (unseasonably warm and sunny) Detroit. Let‚Äôs see what the community was up to:</p>

<p>We started the week off strong, packing a ballroom for <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/backstagecon-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BackstageCon</a> on Monday. It was a smorgasbord of some of our active community members at the first official Backstage conference ‚Äî as well as some new faces interested in learning more about Backstage! To welcome us, Roadie‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/martina-if" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martina Iglesias Fernandez</a> and Spotify‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/suuus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suzanne Daniels</a> took center stage. Next up, we listened to three keynotes from the event‚Äôs top sponsors: Roadie‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/dtuite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Tuite</a> enlightened us on how to 10x developer effectiveness for teams, <a href="https://github.com/dzolotusky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Zolotusky</a> from Spotify discussed developer happiness and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spotify-r%26d_backstage-devex-activity-6990305201710587904-SnDQ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/spotify-plugins-for-backstage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage</a> are launching soon, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentinaalaria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentina Alaria</a> from VMware Tanzu talked about how to curate the Backstage experience to enable developer velocity. In between some creative snacks (lemon blueberry popcorn, anyone?) and coffee breaks, we heard from adopters including <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/building-for-simplicity-TELUS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telus</a>, <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/dazn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAZN</a>, HP, US Bank, and more on lessons learned through their adoption journeys, we talked about different ways to leverage data within Backstage, and we discussed new ways to customize Backstage for specific adopter needs.</p>
<p>You can watch all the BackstageCon sessions, talks, and keynotes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>

<p>The following day, the Backstage maintainers hosted a lively project meeting, where we engaged with a lot of folks that had been at BackstageCon the day before. Over the course of the meeting, the Backstage community talked through recommended approaches for maintaining your Software Catalog as a source of truth, sourcing internal contributors for organization‚Äôs Backstage apps, improving frontend performance in a few plugins, how Backstage maintainers work, and appreciation for the contributions from our community. You can read more detailed notes from the project meeting in the repo <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/project-meetings/kubecon-na-2022.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

At KubeCon, the Backstage team met and greeted so many new faces at our kiosk in the Project Pavilion. We ran demos, answered questions, and handed out lots and lots of SWAG!</p>

<p>Spotify‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/fcorti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Francesco Corti</a> and core maintainer <a href="https://github.com/benjdlambert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Lambert</a> took the stage on Wednesday to present the Backstage maintainer talk to a PACKED audience. They discussed how core features of Backstage are changing the way end-user developers interact and manage their ecosystem, and encouraged folks to create the future of developer experience with the rest of the Backstage community. If you missed it, no worries! Their talk track will be posted on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/cloudnativefdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs a wrap! What an incredible week. Our growing Backstage community continues to amaze us with its dedication and enthusiasm. We can‚Äôt wait to see you all again at KubeCon Europe in The Netherlands! In fact, we‚Äôd love to see our adopters give Backstage talks next year (hint, hint). The KubeCon Europe <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/cfp/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CFP is open</a> until Friday, November 18, 2022.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> If you didn't know, now you know: the Backstage plugin analytics API is here to help you understand how developers in your organization are using Backstage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The Plugin Analytics API" src="https://backstage.io/assets/images/analytics-api-fyi-c26c23b9aae00e45ee0cf4a4661c806c.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-plugin-analytics-api">What is the plugin analytics API?<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/09/08/fyi-plugin-analytics-api#what-is-the-plugin-analytics-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the plugin analytics API?" title="Direct link to What is the plugin analytics API?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The plugin analytics API is a <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/api/utility-apis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">utility api</a> available by default in every Backstage instance, intended to bridge the gap between the needs of Backstage integrators and plugin developers. While Backstage integrators want visibility into the plugins they‚Äôve installed, they lack the power to instrument those plugins. And although plugin developers have the power to instrument plugins, they can‚Äôt do so without a single, vendor-agnostic way to track events. Enter: the plugin analytics API.</p>
<p>While ‚Äúanalytics‚Äù as a concept can be broad, the goal of the API is narrowly focused: empower those deploying Backstage to understand usage of their instance. The plugin analytics API isn‚Äôt designed to solve for observability use-cases like tracing, logging, performance monitoring, error metrics, or alerting. Rather, the API is designed to capture and quantify real user interactions, which can form the basis for metrics like daily active users, top plugins, and more.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="start-collecting-data">Start collecting data<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/09/08/fyi-plugin-analytics-api#start-collecting-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Start collecting data" title="Direct link to Start collecting data">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Backstage core (and a few other plugins) are already instrumented with <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/analytics#key-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key events</a> that are ready for you to start collecting and analyzing.</p>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to use one of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/analytics#supported-analytics-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported analytics tools</a> and install its provided API implementation like you would any other utility API. For example:</p>

<p>If your chosen analytics tool doesn‚Äôt have an integration yet, you can write a custom integration by <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/analytics#writing-integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following these instructions</a>. (And if you‚Äôre integrating with a publicly available analytics service, as opposed to a custom in-house system, why not <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/create-a-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consider contributing it back to the community</a>?)</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="instrument-plugins">Instrument plugins<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/09/08/fyi-plugin-analytics-api#instrument-plugins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Instrument plugins" title="Direct link to Instrument plugins">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>While some key events are already instrumented, there may be important actions in open source plugins that are un-instrumented, not to mention in your custom, InnerSource plugins. Luckily, the plugin analytics API can be leveraged by open source and InnerSource plugins all the same.</p>
<p>To capture an event, invoke the <code>useAnalytics()</code> react hook and call the function it returns when the user performs the action you wish to track (e.g. merging a pull request):</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt worry about having to stuff additional levels of detail into just the event action and subject, you can provide extra dimensional data on the <code>attributes</code> property, as well as a primary metric on the <code>value</code> property, like this:</p>

<p>In situations where your plugin is tracking multiple events and you want all of those events to share common dimensional data, you can use the <code>&lt;AnalyticsContext&gt;</code>. Every event captured in child components underneath this context automatically inherits the values you set:</p>

<p>In fact, Backstage core uses an <code>&lt;AnalyticsContext&gt;</code> to automatically decorate every event with a corresponding plugin ID and an extension name in order to facilitate plugin-level analysis.</p>

<p>As an <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incubating project</a> within the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>, Backstage was fortunate enough to take advantage of a sponsored security audit. The <a href="https://ostif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF)</a> sponsored the audit as part of its ongoing efforts to secure the open source software ecosystem, and the audit itself was performed by <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X41 D-Sec</a>. Our goal with the audit was to evaluate and improve Backstage‚Äôs security posture, focusing on the core Backstage framework and plugins.</p>

<p>The security audit and improvements concluded earlier this month, on August 18th. The audit <strong>findings</strong> totalled two critical, two high, five medium, and three low severity vulnerabilities, alongside 15 side findings with no direct security impact. As of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage 1.5 release</a>, eight out of the 12 main findings and many of the side findings are fully remedied. If you are a few versions behind there‚Äôs no need to worry though, most fixes were included in the 1.3 release.</p>
<p>Out of the four findings that have yet to be fixed, three are related to rate limiting or internal DoS concerns. With the introduction of the Backstage Threat Model (more on that below), Backstage‚Äôs positioning states that this is outside the scope of the security concerns of Backstage. Rather, we trust internal users of Backstage to not intentionally sabotage the availability of the service. This is not to say that we will never aim to get these findings addressed, but we have pushed them to be potential future improvements as we focus our near-term efforts on improving the product in other ways.</p>
<p>The last outstanding finding is to build out the capabilities of our service-to-service auth system. This is an area where the audit identified a couple of missing pieces in our early version of the implementation. We have since closed the gap by introducing token expiration, and will continue to work on this as we open up for more complex and hardened deployment patterns through the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/11611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evolution of the backend system</a>.</p>
<p>Another important finding was the potential for confusion and user impersonation due to most authentication providers having sign-in enabled by default. This finding reinforced our decision to switch sign-in to being disabled by default for all authentication providers, which was part of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.1 release</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important outcome of this audit is that it helped us focus our efforts to keep improving the security of Backstage. It identified priority areas in both implementation and documentation for us going forward. One particular area that was pointed out in a finding is the documentation around the security model of Backstage deployment. There have been several efforts to highlight this in documentation, but it is still not clear enough. What we‚Äôve been lacking is documentation that is completely dedicated towards detailing the security concerns of Backstage. That is why in addition to publishing the security audit report, we are also introducing the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-backstage-threat-model">Introducing the Backstage Threat Model<a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/08/23/backstage-security-audit#introducing-the-backstage-threat-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing the Backstage Threat Model" title="Direct link to Introducing the Backstage Threat Model">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The existing Backstage documentation has many security concerns interwoven within its text, but to find them all, you need to spend a lot of time reading. We previously lacked a one-stop-shop for readers that are interested in the security model and concerns of Backstage. So, we are happy to introduce the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a>, which closes this gap. The Threat Model outlines key security considerations for operators, developers, and security researchers. It is a living document that will evolve and expand alongside the Backstage project.</p>
<p>The threat model document covers the trust model and roles involved in a typical Backstage setup, the responsibilities that fall on integrators of Backstage, and common configuration concerns across all Backstage projects. Beyond these three topics, it also dives deeper into a number of core features. The <code>auth</code>, <code>catalog</code>, <code>scaffolder</code>, and <code>techdocs</code> plugins are all covered separately with their individual security concerns.</p>
<p>We‚Äôd like to point out a few key parts in case you are in a rush. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the integrator's responsibility to protect the Backstage installation from unauthorized access. If you ingest organizational data into the catalog and use that to sign in users, you‚Äôll also want to check out the first halves of the authentication and catalog sections.</p>
